My name is Justin M. Keyes. I am a [non-linear, first-order component](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Characterizing+people+as+non-linear%2c+first-order+components+in+software+development) in the software industry.

This blog is becoming a little too serious, so have a look at [this sardonic comic](http://xkcd.com/904/).
