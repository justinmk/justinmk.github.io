It is a question that you will face, should you deign to start a blog (or column, journal, etc.).

> EUTHYPHRO: Why do you have a blog?
>
> YOU: Because it exercises my urchin mind and I want to share my meager kibbles with SearchEngineGod.

**Weak answer.** Too cliché. We must find a better answer.

_10 weeks later..._

> YOU: Friend, ask me "Why do you have a blog?" again!
>
> EUTHYPHRO: You still have a blog?
>
> YOU: —Yes. I implore you, repeat your question of ten weeks heretofore.
>
> EUTHYPHRO: Why do you have a blog?
>
> YOU: I wrote a blog post to answer that thoroughly.

> EUTHYPHRO: *\[flees]*


**Why write ~~a blog~~:**

- **If it isn't indexed, it doesn't exist.** Content that is difficult to find will reach very few people.
- **Publishing has never been easier.** The printing press afforded the unordained voice an audience beyond the town square, disturbing the Church¹, and later the Crown², as digital media disturb the Press now.
- **Documentation matters.**
    - Fred Brooks elucidates: "Only when one writes do the gaps appear and the inconsistencies protrude. The act of writing turns out to require hundreds of mini-decisions, and it is the existence of these that distinguishes clear, exact policies from fuzzy ones."
- Writing is a **mnemonic (and error-correction) device:** writing = grokking.
    - [Ed Boyden](https://web.archive.org/web/20080903204101/http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/boyden/21925/) pontificates: "Synthesize new ideas constantly. Never read passively. Annotate, model, think, and synthesize while you read... Document everything obsessively. ... Much of creativity is learning how to see things properly..."
- Publishing—even informally—forces you to finish thoughts/tasks/experiments/projects, whereby to put them in a form that is presentable to an audience.
- Writing answers questions that even _you_ may struggle to answer, such as: 
    - What have you been up to? 
    - What did you do last year? 
    - What's new in your fabulous life?
- **Production.** You have studied, and pondered, and mastered difficult concepts--but what have you produced? What is the result of these ministrations, beyond erudite ether? Are you boiling your experiences and annealing your thoughts into a tangible form?
