Microservices: anchoring to reality

TODO: http://www.infoq.com/protocol/

it seems to me the microservices hype is rediscovering the idea of protocols
i.e., common rules for interaction,  which makes details about the implementations unimportant

http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ApiVsProtocol

> protocols [...] provide the most flexibility. Program layers can evolve
> independently of each other. APIs, like CORBA, usually infect the top most
> layer down to the bottom most layer which create serious dependencies between
> layers

http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/07/protocol-design-sbe-thompson

> A protocol is an agreed set of interactions [...] governed by rules.
> [...] The protocol for interacting to a file is an open action, followed by
> zero or more read/write actions, then followed by a close action.
> [...] We use protocols all the time in our everyday lives. Without protocols
> we would descend into chaos. Without protocols we would not be able to
> collectively achieve great things. 

> an API can be improved when people pause and map out the possible interaction
> patterns and then document these into a protocol. Calling a method on an
> object is just passing it a message, albeit in a very coupled way given most
> programming languages. As we take a more decoupled approach the messages
> become first class concepts that really benefit from being organised into
> a protocol. Documenting our protocols help refine them and make a system
> easier to understand.

[Microservice Versioning][versioning]
=====================================

* `Interface.Feature.Bugfix`
* v1.2.3 to v1.2.4: canary test then remove old version
* v1.2.x to v1.3.x:
  * canary test then remove or keep both
  * route v1.3.x clients to new version to get new feature
  * remove v1.2.x only after v1.3.x is found to work for v1.2.x clients
* v1.x.x to v2.x.x:
  * route clients to specific versions
  * remove old server version when all old clients are gone
