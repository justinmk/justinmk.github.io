title: Sunset Rubdown
---

Big Time invented a new adult beverage Ã  la plage. Its working title was "Frankenberry"; the release title is "Sunset Rubdown".

Drink recipe:

- a good splash of Malibu coconut rum
- a grave splash of Cointreau (triple sec)
- a lil' can of pineapple juice
- put the ice in now
- a nice bath of sangria on top

The bedrock of ice breaks the fall of the sangria, and the two forbidden flavors are stratified like an ice-cream cake sunset.
