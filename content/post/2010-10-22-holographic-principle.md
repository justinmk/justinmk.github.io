I am [reading about](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dtvpt/hogans_holometer_physicists_devise_a_way_to_test/) and [attempting](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dtvpt/hogans_holometer_physicists_devise_a_way_to_test/c130ktu) to [discuss](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dtvpt/hogans_holometer_physicists_devise_a_way_to_test/c130n9t) the [holographic principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), a conjecture in theoretical physics that the three-dimensional universe is a projection of a two-dimensional (i.e., surface area) encoding¹. This would imply that all the particles and properties and **everything** of our universe may be [compressed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) _substantially_ without losing information: reality is a (logical, not literal) projection of a very large bitmap.
The theory also could "explain" surprising properties of the universe, such as [the discrete (i.e., quantum) nature](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dtvpt/hogans_holometer_physicists_devise_a_way_to_test/c130wfv)² of physics, the [origin of gravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2487), and [information density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle#Limit_on_information_density).

Most fixating is the idea that the universe may be [regarded as a composition of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle#High-level_summary). I've been obsessed with information, consciously or unconsciously, since I can remember; and, the more I have thought about the nature of reality, the more I have flirted with the conclusion that information is the fundamental problem of existence: processing, encoding, retrieving, organizing, relating, and communicating.

Another thought: In engineering and business _applications_, [numerical analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method) is used to approximate solutions to continuous functions; and in scientific _theory,_ continuous functions are used to approximate a _discrete reality_ resulting from the holographic principle. If I'm not mistaken, this would mean that scientific models like the [Schrödinger equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) may be a little too perfect.

Update (2023): via [Andrew Côté](https://twitter.com/Andercot/status/1741837072632332649):

"computing" is when physical systems "do their thing" - when two atoms bond together, when molecules react, when a cellular organelle churns out a protein, when an animal develops immunity to a disease - all these physical processes are of the nature of transforming information, I.e. the physical configuration of things, according to some state machine or transformation matrix or Hamiltonian operator - some set of rules determine what happens with the next clock cycle.
