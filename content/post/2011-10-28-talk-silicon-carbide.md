<i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #666666;">Abstract:&nbsp;Amorphous silicon carbide (SiC) has been used for several years as a non-biofouling coating in biomedical devices such as coronary stents and bone implants. However, up to recently, the biocompatibility of single crystal SiC, which presents appealing bio-sensing potentialities, has been in question. A comprehensive study of the biocompatibility of this wide band-gap semiconductor has been performed with extremely promising results which show the higher performance of SiC in bio-environments with respect to Si, the leading semiconductor, and introduce SiC into a unique class of materials that is both bio- and hemocompatible.&nbsp;</span></i></blockquote>

Carbon electrodes: replace gold/metal electrodes which can become toxic.<br />

Semiconductors (Si):<br />
{{< /rawhtml >}}

- long-term (unlike polymers)
- won't corrode (unlike metals, eventually)
- ...but is it biocompatible/hemocompatible?

Silicon Carbide (SiC):

- biocompatible ("in vivo")
- hemocompatible ("in vitro")
- **very** wide bandgap (low carrier concentration)&nbsp;
    - "If we can make a switch using SiC, there will be effectively **no** leakage current".
- 3x as hard as Si
- 3x as flexible as Si

SiC is "like bone". Bone tissue can grow on SiC, but dies on Si.<br />
<br />
3C-SiC: "cubic form" of SiC, works better than 4H-SiC (hexagonal).<br />
<br />
CNS, PNS: body naturally fails by open-circuit (as opposed to short-circuit).<br />
<br />
A high concentration of glial cells&nbsp;on the implant indicates poor biocompatibility (immuno-inflammatory response).<br />
<br />
Blood-brain barrier. Brain "eats" Si&nbsp;("poison").<br />
<br />
SiC shows microglia only found near the surface.<br />
<br />
<b>Q:</b> Why do neurons "eat" Si, but not SiC?<br />
<b>A:</b> It appears that the neurons "go on a diet" after C layer is encountered (SiC is "Si wrapping C, wrapping Si, wrapping C, ...").<br />
<br />
<b>Q:</b> What is preventing the use of SiC as a replacement in biomedical applications which currently use Si?<br />
<b>A:</b> Mostly, cost of materials (and&nbsp;manufacturing?). The process is not perfected.<br />
