I [presented a keynote](https://youtu.be/Bt-vmPC_-Ho?t=23) at
[VimConf 2019](https://vimconf.org/2019/#menu-keynote-speakers).
The organizers wrote some notes [here](https://vimconf.wordpress.com/2019/11/21/vimconf-2019-is-over/).

The first part of the talk is a sermon about the state of text-editing art,
with perhaps novel insights. The rest of the talk is an exposition of recent
[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) tech.

The main themes are:

1. System vs Application
2. Legacy paradox
3. Leverage = (impact / cost)

There were [too many slides](https://vimconf.org/2019/slides/justin.pdf).
I spent years thinking about these topics, and weeks building the talk.  But
I ran out of time :)

Some people were very enthusiastic about the talk.  A few people mentioned that
I need to work on my delivery.  Yeah, I already knew that :)
