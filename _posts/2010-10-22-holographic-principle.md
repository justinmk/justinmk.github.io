title: 'The Holographic Principle'

I am <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dtvpt/hogans_holometer_physicists_devise_a_way_to_test/">reading about</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dtvpt/hogans_holometer_physicists_devise_a_way_to_test/c130ktu">attempting</a> to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dtvpt/hogans_holometer_physicists_devise_a_way_to_test/c130n9t">discuss</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">holographic principle</a>, a conjecture in theoretical physics that the three-dimensional universe is a projection of a two-dimensional (i.e., surface area) encoding<sup>1</sup>. This would imply that all the particles and properties and <b>everything</b> of our universe may be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">compressed</a> <i>substantially </i>without losing information: reality is a (logical, not literal) projection of a very large bitmap.
The theory also could "explain" surprising properties of the universe, such as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dtvpt/hogans_holometer_physicists_devise_a_way_to_test/c130wfv">the discrete (i.e., quantum) nature</a><sup>2</sup> of physics, the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2487">origin of gravity</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle#Limit_on_information_density">information density</a>.

Most fixating is the idea that the universe may be [regarded as a composition of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle#High-level_summary). I've been obsessed with information, consciously or unconsciously, since I can remember; and, the more I have thought about the nature of reality, the more I have flirted with the conclusion that information is the fundamental problem of existence: processing, encoding, retrieving, organizing, relating, and communicating.

Another thought: In engineering and business <i>applications</i>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method">numerical analysis</a> is used to approximate solutions to continuous functions; and in scientific <i>theory,</i> continuous functions are used to approximate a <i>discrete reality</i> resulting from the holographic principle. If I'm not mistaken, this would mean that scientific models like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schrödinger equation</a> may be a little too perfect.

Update (2023): via [Andrew Côté](https://twitter.com/Andercot/status/1741837072632332649):

"computing" is when physical systems "do their thing" - when two atoms bond together, when molecules react, when a cellular organelle churns out a protein, when an animal develops immunity to a disease - all these physical processes are of the nature of transforming information, I.e. the physical configuration of things, according to some state machine or transformation matrix or Hamiltonian operator - some set of rules determine what happens with the next clock cycle.
