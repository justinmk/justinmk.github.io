human singularity: compulsive excellence (Fountainhead)

neuro-chic: designer DNA trivializes current human cognitive limiations, perhaps changes human nature such that current human inclinations are obsolete

technological singularity: AI, self-replicating nanobots = telekinesis

energy singularity: near-perpetual motion

One who overcomes his apparent nature is far more interesting than one whose nature is effortlessly extraordinary.

The extraordinary are the drivers of stability and improvement.
