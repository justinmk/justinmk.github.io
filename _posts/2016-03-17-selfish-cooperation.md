title: Economies of scale and self-interested cooperation
---

Fascinating conclusion quietly tucked away in the last slide of a [2011 Netflix
cloud talk](http://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/netflix-velocity-conference-2011/64):

> * Cloud Standardization?
>       * Cloud features and APIs should be a commodity not a differentiator
>       * Differentiate on scale and quality of service
>       * Competition also drives cost down

That competition and standardization is desirable and beneficial at the
_individual level_, is a powerful insight—perhaps also employed by Google with
its Chrome and Android strategy.

[ESR made the case](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=928), more than once, that there
exists an _economic_ motivation for sharing code. Charity-based models are not
sustainable. Open source works because it has utility for both parties. If
there weren't utility, then allocation—priorities—would suffer heavily (cf. GNU
Hurd)...

Intriguing because it is counterintuitive, but it may not square with the AWS
model: large AWS customers are able to negotiate discounts on [the most
expensive component of AWS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11301085):
traffic; smaller customers are paying [hidden costs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11301229).

By the way, Mr. Cockcroft is prolific in the talking space:
