title: Economies of scale and self-interested cooperation

Quietly tucked away in the last slide of a [2011
Netflix cloud talk](http://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/netflix-velocity-conference-2011/64)
(Mr. Cockcroft [talks a lot](http://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/presentations)):

> Cloud Standardization?
>
>   * Cloud features and APIs should be a commodity not a differentiator
>   * Differentiate on scale and quality of service
>   * Competition also drives cost down

This is a claim that competition and standardization are desirable and beneficial
at the _individual_ levelâ€”an insight perhaps also employed by Google with its
Chrome and Android strategy.

[ESR made the case](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=928) that there is economic
motivation for sharing code. This was corroborated years later
[by OpenNT](https://medium.com/@stephenrwalli/running-linux-apps-on-windows-and-other-stupid-human-tricks-part-i-acbf5a474532):

> Recognize that none of these contributions back to the community were out of

> Despite the initial time to market advantage of using open source, if we had

Open source has utility for both parties. If there weren't utility, then allocation
(priorities) would suffer heavily (cf. GNU Hurd).

Also from the Netflix slides:

> _We would prefer to be an insignificant customer in a giant cloud._

Intriguing because it is counterintuitive, but it may not square with the AWS
model: large AWS customers are able to negotiate discounts on [the most
expensive component of AWS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11301085):
traffic; smaller customers are paying [hidden costs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11301229).
