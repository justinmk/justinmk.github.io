title: 'Impossible Ideas'
---

Corollary to Paul Graham's <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">frighteningly ambitious startup ideas</a>: a list of <i>impossible ideas</i> that interest me personally.

- ubiquitous, secure, painless (one-click) bitcoin payment
- ubiquitous, effortless, anonymous, encrypted communication
- painless, anonymous, decentralized internet access
- effortless expense/receipt management
- effortless information management / mind mapping

Working on the impossible is like exercise: if you produce something _half good_ then you have something better than any existing similar product.
